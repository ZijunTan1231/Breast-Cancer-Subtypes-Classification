# Breast Cancer Subtypes Classification
School Project

• Conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing, enhancing model precision and efficiency by applying label encoding and
employing Random Forest for feature selection.

• Developed and optimized supervised learning algorithms (KNN, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, XGBoost), achieving
a 94% AUC.

• Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for comprehensive exploratory data analysis, visualizing patterns and communicating model
performance results.
